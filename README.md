# DA-RailwayNetwork

[Project Description](https://github.com/Mansur-Mustafin/DA-RailwayNetwork/blob/master/ProjectDescription.pdf)

## Description:

An Analysis Tool for Railway Network Management

An analysis tool that can support the management team of a railway network to make informed decisions about how to best allocate its resources, both financial as well as physical (e.g., trains).

This tool, which will use a realistic data set, will allow management to decide on aspects such as how to best assign selected trains to lines, how to maximize its revenue when multiple levels of service are offered, or even, identify more sensitive sections of its network to failures so as to anticipate service disruption or at least to mitigate its nefarious effects.

## Features implemented

Flows:
* Maximum ﬂow between stations
* Railways and Pairs of Stations with the most trains
* Top k Municipalities and/or Districts that require the most amount of trains
* Number of trains that arrive on a speciﬁc station

Network:
* Minimum cost to maintain maximum ﬂow in a network
* Maximum ﬂow in the segments/stations of a reduced network
* Most affected Stations in a reduced network

Additional: 
* Add Stations to a Graph (as vertices)
* Add Railways to a Graph (as edges)
* Change the ﬁle(s) from which the Graph’s Stations and Railways are loaded
* Read the ﬁle containing the Stations and their attributes
* Read the ﬁle containing the Railways and their attributes
